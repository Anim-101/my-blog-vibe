# Serenity at the Alpine Lake

This photo was captured during a multi-day hike through the pristine wilderness. The still waters perfectly reflected the towering peaks at dawn.

When shooting landscapes like this, patience is key. I had to wait nearly three hours for the morning mist to roll away and the wind to die down completely to get this glass-like reflection.
