# A Study on Data Compression

This project was developed as my core dissertation. The thesis was entitled **"Building a New Approach to Data Compression by Understanding, Implementing, Updating, and Comparing Standard Techniques."**

## Overview

The primary goal of this research project was to deeply analyze the structural efficiency of various standard data compression algorithms. I aimed not only to understand how legacy and modern compression techniques work under the hood but to actively implement, update, and rigorously compare them.

## Technical Implementation

The entire project was architected and written in **C**. 

I followed a strict version table to methodically build out and code standard algorithms for both:
- Data Compression Encoders
- Data Compression Decoders

By doing this from scratch at a low level, I could precisely measure the CPU cycles, memory footprints, and lossless/lossy ratios between the respective structures.

## Contributions & Outcomes

- Hand-coded C algorithms demonstrating compression methodologies.
- Delivered a foundational research dissertation comparing standard techniques.
- Established a new approach or perspective on optimizing standard encoder/decoder pipelines.
- Explored both practical structural constraints and mathematical underpinnings of compression theories.

*All structural low-level algorithm code can be found in my public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Anim-101/A-Study-on-Data-Compression).*
